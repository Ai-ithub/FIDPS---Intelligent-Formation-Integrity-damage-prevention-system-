## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the **Intelligent Formation Integrity & Damage Prevention System (FIDPS)**, an integrated software platform designed to **identify, predict, analyze, and prevent** formation damage in real-time during oil and gas drilling, completion, and production operations. FIDPS leverages machine learning, physical simulations, and a robust data pipeline to enhance decision-making and optimize operational efficiency.

### 1.2 System Scope
FIDPS is a comprehensive system that ingests real-time and historical data from field sensors (MWD/LWD), validates it, processes it through machine learning models for prediction and classification, runs simulations for deeper analysis, and presents all insights through an interactive visual dashboard. It is designed for use by drilling engineers, production managers, and petrophysicists in both onshore and offshore environments.

- **Multi-Model ML Engine:** Employs a suite of algorithms (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, etc.) for classification, regression, and anomaly detection.
- **Physical Simulation Integration:** Uses OpenFOAM/FEniCS for simulating damage processes like fluid loss and emulsion formation.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A web-based UI for real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and alert management.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** A module for creating high-fidelity synthetic data to augment training and testing.

### 2.3 Constraints
- Requires high-frequency (‚â•1 Hz), high-integrity sensor data streams.
- Performance is dependent on GPU resources for model training and complex simulations.
- Must be operable in environments with intermittent network connectivity.
