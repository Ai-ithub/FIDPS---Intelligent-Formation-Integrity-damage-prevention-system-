I have updated the comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to include the detailed requirements for the **Dashboard (FR-5)**. Specifically, I've mandated the use of **React.js** for the frontend, and specified the integration of **Kafka, Grafana, and Prometheus** for real-time monitoring of all core items, including sensor data and analytical results (RTO, DVR, PdM).

The requirements for real-time, simultaneous, and serial data reading from sensors have been integrated into the **Data Ingestion (FR-1)** and **NFR** sections.

Here is the complete and final SRS for the FIDPS.
